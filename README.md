## RISC-V 32-bit Base ISA Implementation

This was my attempt to gain a better understanding of computer architecture
by writing an implementation of the RISC-V ISA
from the ground up in a structural style.

Please note that this project is incomplete and cannot be compiled.
I am simply saving it from rotting away on my hard drive.

Though I wrote all of these modules myself,
many of them were originally written for
a project I worked on under the guidance of
Professor John Brunhaver at Arizona State University.
