## RISC-V 32-bit Base ISA Implementation

This was my feeble attempt to hack together a simple RISC-V processor that I could run on an Altera Cyclone V.

Please note that this project currently is NOT functional.
I just wanted to save it from rotting away on my hard drive.
I hope to be able to return to it someday in the future.

Though I wrote all of these modules myself, many of them were taken from a project I worked on
under the guidance of Professor John Brunhaver at Arizona State University.
